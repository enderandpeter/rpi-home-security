# Raspberry Pi Motion Detecting Camera

A script for using a passive infrared motion detector to detect motion and recording video with a Pi Camera for the purpose
of security.

This script is based on the [Parent Detector](https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/parent-detector/) tutorial project.

Make sure the camera is connected and the PiCamera modules enabled. [See this guide](https://www.raspberrypi.org/learning/getting-started-with-picamera/worksheet/) for getting set up.
The motion detector should be connected on GPIO 4 (for Raspyberry Pi 3).
